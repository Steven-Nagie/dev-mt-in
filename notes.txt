TO DO
HTML
3. format sign up div to be the proper width and have the proper bottom margin
4. Finish styling update inputs (borders/shadows)
5. On landing page change search icon to miniature blue photo triangle.
6. Fix triangle size
7. Fix triangle position so that they are more centered in their containing div. As it is right now they are shooting out left and leaving a great deal of white space on their right.
8. Put blue color on pictures.
9. Profile full name should be offset.
10. Search feature for friends (also implement it for strangers. They don't ask for it, but it makes sense.)
11. Hover effect on friends and strangers pictures.
  --Lay a div on top of the picture and hide it until we hover over it.
  --Include ng-model so it knows which information to push to the profile when you click.
  --Make sure to change picture as well when you do the click.
12. Blue underlines when a certain nav bar link has been clicked.
  --Do this with a containing div, perhaps, like what Steven did with the moving underline feature he built.

JS
1. Have a way to access old user profiles using current local storage set up.
2. Figure out how to properly rotate the three different views for each side.
3. Set it up to save the strangers list to local storage so we don't have to make the api call every time we refresh the page. Do this with an if statement, same way we have the user profiles set up.
4. Make the api get call get more than 20 people at a time. And not just the first however many of the alphabet. Get a wide range.

Remaining views
1. The view friends and friends profile page are just the exact same thing we already have, except the friend's profile page has their info (which will be an angular thing) and a blue "add friend bar".
2. View friends and add friends will be the exact same styling, only populated with different information.
  --To style it, just use flex-wrap with all the images.

Other
1. Why does it load every element at once and then snap into it's proper formation?

Friends view
1. Put link to friend's profile on top of image.
2. Change search icon to back arrow.

As far as populating a friend's or stranger's profile page, it seems the easiest way to do so would be to create a new hidden div and make it appear when you click their photo. However, I would like it better if we could keep the user profile div we have, and simply switch the information.

name: stranger.name
tag:
bio: stranger.description
